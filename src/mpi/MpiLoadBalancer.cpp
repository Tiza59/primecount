/// @file  MpiLoadBalancer.cpp
/// @brief The MpiLoadBalancer evenly distributes the computation
///        of the hard special leaves onto cluster nodes.
///
///        Simply parallelizing the computation of the special
///        leaves in the Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko algorithm by
///        subdividing the sieve interval by the number of threads
///        into equally sized subintervals does not scale because
///        the distribution of the special leaves is highly skewed
///        and most special leaves are in the first few segments
///        whereas later on there are very few special leaves.
///
///        This MpiLoadBalancer gradually increases the number of
///        segments to sieve as long the expected runtime of the
///        sieve distance is smaller than the expected finish time
///        of the algorithm. Near the end the MpiLoadBalancer will
///        gradually decrease the number of segments to sieve in
///        order to prevent that 1 thread will run much longer
///        than all the other threads.
