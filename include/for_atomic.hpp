///        The for_atomic_inc() macro is a workaround for a severe
///        scaling issue in Clang's OpenMP library when using a parallel
///        for loop with schedule(dynamic). More details can be found
///        in my bug report: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49588
///
///        Note that the atomic for loops in this file are optimal for
///        primecount's use case. Unlike GCC's OpenMP library which
///        uses atomics with memory_order_acq_rel our implementation
///        uses atomics with memory_order_relaxed because our threads
///        are completely independent from each other. This improves
///        performance on CPU architectures with a weak memory model
///        such as ARM64. Also since our algorithms perform best using
///        a chunk size of 1 we can hardcode that value.
